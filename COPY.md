## FAQ
**Q: Where does the data come from?**
A: We pull real sold and active listing data from eBay, the world's largest resale marketplace. Poshmark and Mercari data coming soon.

**Q: How is sell-through rate calculated?**
A: Items Sold (90 days) ÷ (Items Sold + Currently Active) × 100. Above 50% = strong demand. Below 20% = slow mover.

**Q: Do I need an account?**
A: Nope — you get 5 free checks per day without signing up. Create a free account to save your search history, or upgrade to Pro for unlimited checks.

**Q: Can I use this on my phone?**
A: Absolutely. SellChecker is mobile-first. Install it as an app on your home screen (it's a PWA — no app store needed).
