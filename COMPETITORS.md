# SellChecker — Competitive Landscape

## Direct Competitors

| Tool | Price | Platforms | Mobile | Our Advantage |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Terapeak** | Free (eBay sellers) | eBay only | No | Buried in Seller Hub, complex UI, requires eBay account |
| **ZIK Analytics** | $15/mo | eBay only | No | Overwhelming UI, designed for Amazon arbitrage, not thrift resellers |
| **Vendoo** | $15–70/mo | Multi | App | Focused on crosslisting, price checker is secondary and basic |
| **List Perfectly** | $29–49/mo | Multi | Web | Crosslisting tool, not market research |
| **3Dsellers** | $15–30/mo | eBay | No | Full seller suite, overkill for just checking sell-through |
| **WorthPoint** | $25/mo | Antiques | No | Niche antiques/collectibles pricing, not general resale |

## Our Positioning

**We are NOT a full seller suite.** We do ONE thing exceptionally well:
tell you if something will sell before you buy it.

### What makes SellChecker different:
1. **Speed** — Answer in <2 seconds. No navigating through menus.
2. **Simplicity** — One search bar. One answer. BUY or PASS.
3. **Mobile-first** — Built for the thrift store aisle, not a desktop.
4. **Free tier** — 5 checks/day, no credit card, no eBay account needed.
5. **Price** — $10/mo vs $15–70 for tools that do way more than you need.

### Target User Persona
- **Name:** "Thrift Store Tina"
- **Profile:** Part-time reseller, sells on 1–3 platforms, sources at thrift stores / garage sales
- **Pain:** Stands in thrift store wondering "will this sell?" — doesn't want to look up eBay comps manually
- **Budget:** Willing to pay $10/mo if it clearly saves money on bad buys
- **Devices:** Primarily phone, sometimes laptop for listing

### Secondary Persona
- **Name:** "Side Hustle Sam"
- **Profile:** Newer reseller, still learning what sells. Has inventory sitting because they bought wrong things.
- **Pain:** Doesn't know brands/categories well enough yet. Needs data to build intuition.
- **Budget:** Free tier initially, upgrades when they see the value

## Market Size
- ~5 million active resellers in the US (eBay, Poshmark, Mercari, Depop)
- Secondhand apparel market: $256 billion (2025), growing 15x faster than traditional retail
- If we capture 0.01% of US resellers at $10/mo = $50K MRR
- If we capture 0.1% = $500K MRR

## Key Risks
1. **eBay API access for sold data** — Marketplace Insights API is limited release. Mitigation: Terapeak fallback, apply early.
2. **Multi-platform data** — Poshmark/Mercari have no public APIs. Mitigation: Launch with eBay, add others via partnerships or data collection later.
3. **User acquisition** — Reseller community is tight-knit but noisy. Mitigation: Free tier for word-of-mouth, partner with YouTube creators.
4. **Copycats** — Low barrier to entry. Mitigation: Move fast, build community, add features that create switching costs (search history, wishlist, alerts).
